 This Calm blueprint allows for the deployment of a Microsoft SQL database to existing Database Server VMs that are managed by Nutanix Era.  I have included a few basic variables that will allow for deoployment of other DB types.  That will be a future work effort.  For now this is blueprint is strictly focused on deployment of MS SQL database to existing Era managed VMs.

 Developed with the following Nutanix products and versions
    Nutanix AOS 5.18
    Prism Central pc.2020.11 
    Nutanix Calm 3.1.1
    Nutanix Era 2.1.0

To use this blueprint, import into a Prism Central runnin Calm 3.0 or later, modify the variables and credentials as mentioned below.
